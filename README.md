ZAD Style Switcher - An extension for Contao CMS
================================================
Since Contao does not offer a native tool for the insertion of a style switcher in a website,
this extension solves the problem.

A style switcher allows users to choose the preferred style to view your website.
It is also an accessibility tool: you can use it to allow the change of font size,
or to show a high contrast version of the pages.
